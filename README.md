# portfolio-site

creating my portfolio website from the ground up.

Previous portfolio page was made using a premade design and as such I now wish to create one on my own using my current knowledge of vanilla CSS and HTML, perhaps using some of my JavaScript knowledge base also.

Using http://findmatthew.com/ as basis for my site.
Sketched out the broad strokes of the html structure I plan to use.
